# Security Verification using Avispa

- Implementation of 'Designing secure blockchain-based access control scheme in IoT-enabled Internet of Drones deployment' protocol - both Drone to GSS and Drone to Drone parts. 
- The protocol has been simulated using the OFMC and CL-AtSe backends and it has returned 'SAFE'.
- There are three agents - Control Room, Drone 1, and Drone 2.
- Control Room registers the drones and then Drone 1 and Drone 2 communicate with each other to get the shared secret key.
